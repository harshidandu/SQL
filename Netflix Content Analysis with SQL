-- Project Title: Netflix Content Analysis

-- Project Description: 
-- This project involves querying Netflix data to extract insights about TV shows and movies available on the platform. 
-- Two different approaches are demonstrated: one utilizing a local PostgreSQL database with local data, and the other querying a remote database accessed through a GitHub repository path.

-- Approach 1: Local PostgreSQL Database

-- Data Table Creation:
CREATE TABLE netflix_titles_info (
    "show_id" varchar(5),
    "type" varchar(7),
    "title" varchar(58),
    "country" varchar(74),
    "date_added" timestamp,
    "release_year" int,
    "rating" varchar(5),
    "duration" varchar(9),
    "listed_in" varchar(74)
);

CREATE TABLE netflix_people (
    "show_id" varchar(5),
    "director" varchar(54),
    "cast" varchar(532)
);

-- Data Insertion:
INSERT INTO netflix_titles_info
    ("show_id", "type", "title", "country", "date_added", "release_year", "rating", "duration", "listed_in")
VALUES
    -- Insert data rows here;

INSERT INTO netflix_people
    ("show_id", "director", "cast")
VALUES
    -- Insert data rows here;

-- SQL Queries:

-- 1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not TV shows)
SELECT count(*) 
FROM netflix_titles_info
WHERE type='Movie';

-- 2. When was the most recent batch of TV shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT max(date(date_added))
FROM netflix_titles_info;

-- 3. List all the movies and TV shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title
FROM netflix_titles_info
ORDER BY title asc;

-- 4. Who was the Director for the movie "The Starling"?
SELECT director
FROM netflix_titles_info titles
LEFT JOIN netflix_people people ON titles.show_id=people.show_id
WHERE titles.title='The Starling';

-- 5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT title, release_year
FROM netflix_titles_info
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1;

-- Approach 2: Remote Database Accessed via GitHub Repository

-- SQL Queries:

-- 1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not TV shows)
SELECT count(*) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

-- 2. When was the most recent batch of TV shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT max(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

-- 3. List all the movies and TV shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

-- 4. Who was the Director for the movie "Bright Star"?
SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN  "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id=people.show_id
WHERE titles.title='Bright Star';

-- 5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1;
